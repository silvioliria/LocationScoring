# 🚨 Refactoring Safety - Quick Reference

## ⚡ **Before Every Refactoring - CHECK THIS:**

### **🔍 Visual Fidelity**
- [ ] **Screenshot the current state**
- [ ] **Refactor the code**
- [ ] **Screenshot the new state**
- [ ] **Compare - they must be IDENTICAL**

### **⚙️ Functionality Check**
- [ ] **Build succeeds** without warnings
- [ ] **All user actions work** exactly the same
- [ ] **Data flows** identically
- [ ] **Navigation** functions the same

### **📱 Test These Key Flows:**
1. **Location Creation** → Save → Display in list
2. **Location Editing** → Modify → Save changes
3. **Location Deletion** → Remove from list
4. **Score Calculation** → Verify identical results
5. **App Navigation** → All screens accessible

---

## 🚫 **NEVER DO DURING REFACTORING:**
- Change colors, fonts, sizes, spacing
- Modify function behavior
- Remove functionality
- Change data sources
- Refactor multiple areas at once

---

## ✅ **ALWAYS DO DURING REFACTORING:**
- Extract with identical output
- Test after each small change
- Maintain exact same interface
- Use same data/calculation methods
- Document any intentional improvements separately

---

## 🆘 **If Something Breaks:**
1. **STOP** all refactoring
2. **ASSESS** what's broken
3. **FIX** immediately with minimal changes
4. **INVESTIGATE** what went wrong
5. **UPDATE** safeguards

---

**Remember: "If it doesn't look and work exactly the same, it's not ready!"**
